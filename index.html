    <h1>Welcome to my first assignment site!</h1>
    <footer>I'm putting this footer right near the top to test if it will appear at the bottom of the page.</footer>
    <p>This paragraph is next.  Let me test...in what order will this text appear?</p>
    <p>Looks like the content will appear in line order so far, despite the tag used.</p>
    <section>
      <h2>This is the hungry section.</h2>
      <header>By Christina</header>
      <p>I'd like to try out the <b>dataset</b> element</p>
      <p>Which food is the <mark>yummiest?</mark></p>
      <input list ="foods">

      <datalist id="foods">
        <option value="pizza">
        <option value="chocolate mousse">
        <option value="goldfish crackers">
        <option value="grilled cheese sandwich">
        <option value="mole enchiladas">
      </datalist>
      <p>It was a close call, but <em>goldfish crackers</em> are my favorite food!  <br>My tastebuds have not grown up since snack time in kindergarden.</p>

      <h2>This section will contain some reflection from Lesson 1</h2>
      <p>At first, I found myself having a hard time imagining the role of semantic tags in the visual look of a page.  I think this statement from the class reading by Michelle in "An Overview of HTML5 Semantics" helped me start to understand:  <q cite="https://codepen.io/mi-lee/post/an-overview-of-html5-semantics">If we maintain the philosophy that HTML is all about organization of content, and CSS as purely styling, then elements that were purely presentational donâ€™t belong within HTML.</q></p>
      <p>This makes sense to me.  These semantic elements are all about organization.</p>
      <p>UI design/UX is particularly fascinating to me; so I'm excited to get the opportunity to learn about CSS!</p>
